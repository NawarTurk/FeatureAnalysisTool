Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment. Languages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family; in contrast, a language that has been demonstrated to not have any living or non- living relationship with another language is called a language isolate. There are also many unclassified languages whose relationships have not been established, and spurious languages may have not existed at all.","Languages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur.

wiki_414," The modern understanding of the properties of a semiconductor relies on quantum physics to explain the movement of charge carriers in a crystal lattice. Doping greatly increases the number of charge carriers within the crystal. When a doped semiconductor contains mostly free holes it is called \"" p- type\"", and when it contains mostly free electrons it is known as \"" n- type\"". The semiconductor materials used in electronic devices are doped under precise conditions to control the concentration and regions of p- and n- type dopants. A single semiconductor crystal can have many p- and n- type regions; the p – n junctions between these regions are responsible for the useful electronic behavior. Using a hot- point probe, one can determine quickly whether a semiconductor sample is p- or n- type.
